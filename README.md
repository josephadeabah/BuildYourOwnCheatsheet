# **Cheat Sheet: HTML Tables**

This is a simple cheat sheet HTML file, which contains information on how to build tables. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) has been an invaluable exercise in enhancing my skills to write HTML tables.

## Project Prompt

In this project, Iâ€™ll be building my own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.

## Technologies

- HTML 5
- CSS 3

## Setup

Any standard computer browser that can run this site will work as long as it can read HTML 5 and CSS 3. You can click this [link](https://daniellabrador.github.io/codecademy-build_your_own_cheat_sheet/) to view the live site.
